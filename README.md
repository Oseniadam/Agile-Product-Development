**Why a Sprint Planning Meeting is necessary?**

To gather all of the team in one place and let everyone know what their role is, in the upcoming sprint.
This will make your team more confident because there will be no confusion in role management and prioritization of tasks. 
A good team is one that knows what their exact roles are.

Other benefits that a team gets from a sprint planning session are:
Promotes Just In Time planning
Task estimation
Task discovery
A common understanding of the product
Task sign Up
Task prioritization
Collaboration and team building
Knowledge and skill set improvement
Different perspectives

**Done**: This is a record of how many features/story points that you actually achieve.  

**Goal velocity**:  This is a calculated field that counts down the target points to zero (completion of the project). It forms the left side of the chart (the y axis).  

**Remaining**:  This is a calculated field that simply deducts 'Done' from 'Remaining'. 
It forms the blue line showing the actual burndown rate.

# Agile Communication Plan
Communication is key to project success. 
The communication plan sets out what, when and how you will communicate with your project stakeholders.

Project details and document control Provide information on the project and document: 
-----Ref Project Name
-----Ref Project Manager 
-----Ref Document Date 
-----Ref Version number   

**What**:  What document, report or update will be sent.  

**Objective**:  Explain the purpose of the communication. For example --- progress update --- approval/sign-off ---- quality assurance ---- business buy-in.  

**Who**:  The person who will receive the communication.  

**How**:  How the communication will be delivered. For example, via a meeting, email, demonstration, hard-copy report.  

**Media**:  The format of the communication, for example, web-page, knowledge article on intranet, Word doc, PowerPoint, print out.  

**When**: When the communication will be sent. This might be a date for one-off communication or the frequency of regular comms, like weekly progress reports.  

**Responsible**:  The person who is responsible for sending the the communication. This might not be the person who writes the document or message, but they will be accountable for making sure that it goes out.

# Daily Scrum
The Stand-up is a daily meeting for the team to briefly review progress, talk about any blockers, and share their plans for the day. 
Usually the team stand up during the meeting, which encourages everyone to 'keep it short'. 

<img width="522" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57412626/217010209-82ea5adf-da77-4ec9-8c3a-4a0e63f39e1c.png">

##   Rules of the Daily Scrum 
1.  It must start on time. Anyone can join, but only the core team speak. 
2.  The meeting lasts 15 minutes max. 
3.  It must start at the same time and in the same location everyday. 
4.  The Scrum master ensures that the Scrum happens, but the development team (or core team) run it. 
5.  The Scrum master also makes sure that the meeting keeps to time and that only the core team speak. 
6.  Daily Scrum makes it an efficient and effective way to remove obstacles, speed up decisions and improve communications.
7.  **Task**:  Describe in a much detail as possible the tasks that need to be completed to go live/launch.  
8.  **Start and finish date & time Deployment plans**:  Start and finish date & time Deployment plans list step by step what needs to be done to complete go live. Because it is a detailed plan start and finish dates and times are included.  
9.   **Owner**:   Name the person ultimately responsble for the completion of the task. 
If needed you could include contact details.  
10.  **Status**: This is a free text field for the status of each task. 
For example, Open, in progress, completed.  

# Burndown Chart
A Burndown Chart is a graph which shows the work left to do against time. 
It is used in agile project management as a simple indicator of when the work will be completed. 
Typically the work is shown on the y axis and the time on the x axis.
There are lots of variations of the Burndown Chart. 
For example, the work can be expressed in various ways, it could be, features, story points, or effort. 
Time might be the releases, sprints or iterations. 

This template is easily edited to suit your project.

Deployment Plan is a detailed list of the tasks that need to be done for the project to be deployed/go live. 
It includes start and finish dates, and may even be show the time, when a task needs to be completed. The plan should include the technical tasks, like networking --- security --- software install --- and business tasks like new processes --- org structures.

# Product Backlog
The Product Backlog is a list of all the potential features that will be completed during the project. 
It is prioritized by business value and is maintained and updated throughout the project. 
It is the single source of work for the project team, and is used to plan the work to be done in each iteration. 
The backlog is created from the product roadmap. 
As the project progresses the features are refined (broken down) in more detail. 
Because the Product Backlog needs to be refined and updated often an Excel spreadsheet is an ideal format.

# User Story ID 
**The unique reference for the User Story.  
User Story**: The User Story. They are typically written in the format “As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].”  

**Estimate (size)**:  It could be story points, Fibonacci scale or T-shirt sizes - small, medium, large.  

**Priority**:  Enter the priority of the User Story. For example, a number scale, high, medium, low or star rating.  

**Sprint**: The sprint that you plan to build the user story in.  

**Task owner**: An optional field for the person responsible for the completion of the User Story.  

**Estimate effort**: An optional field for the estimate of effort in hours or days.

# Sprint Backlog 
The Sprint Backlog is a list of tasks to be completed during the sprint. During the Sprint Planning meeting, the team choose some User Stories from the Product Backlog, and break down the tasks needed to deliver them. The effort required for each task is estimated and across the sprint. stakeholdermap.com During the sprint the backlog is is updated daily, usually during the Daily Scrum meeting. Tasks may be removed or added as the sprint progresses. To ensure buy-in it is important that the core team complete and own the sprint backlog.

In the days prior, the Product Owners must make sure that all of the items that are a part of the backlog are considered to be discussed in the meeting complete the team’s criteria of being ready.

<img width="683" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57412626/217062814-7964bc5e-d273-4551-bb31-a6a2eb8f8543.png">

These items include bugs, new features, stakeholder feedback and optimizations of all kinds. 
This means that all of these items are properly identified, test cases have been written and all the descriptions have been set. 
This prep work is necessary because if the PO tends to all of this during the meeting, it will be less efficient and very time-consuming for all of the attendees.

# Measurement of User Stories**:  
The Product Owner needs to ensure that every story to be discussed in the meeting is of equal size, and not too long or too little. The team will have a better understanding of performing this task when they would have worked together for a while.

# The Team’s Commitment has to be properly Examined

If you are hosting a sprint planning meeting or just a normal one, an important thing that you have to keep an eye on is everyone’s availability. Is anyone on holiday or are there any company holidays coming? Confirm everyone’s availability on a day and confirm that day for the meeting.

# Plan your Sprint Accordingly with the Team’s Schedule
Sometimes, the resources or the team members are busy elsewhere and they can’t fully commit to providing their services during the sprint. You should gather this information and take it into consideration before you plan the sprint.

# What are the steps involved in the Sprint Planning Meeting?
The following steps happen during the Sprint Planning Meeting:

1. Team Capacity is confirmed
2. Any new information that can impact the plan is discussed
3. The team is reminded of the ultimate goal that they need to achieve
4. Present the velocity to be used for this release
5.  All the known issues and concerns are confirmed
6.  The definition of DONE is reviewed and the appropriate updates are made based on the technology and skill
7.  Present proposed product backlog items to consider for the sprint backlog
8.  Needs of the team are determined, they are signed up to work and the work owed is estimated
9.  Get back to work
10.  Confirm any new issues and concerns raised during meeting and record
11.  Confirm any assumptions or dependencies discovered during planning and record
12.  ScrumMaster calls for a group consensus on the plan
13.  Product Owner answers clarifying questions and elaborates acceptance criteria

# Sprint Retrospective
The Sprint Retrospective happens at the end of each sprint and is an opportunity to review progress and make improvement. 
The team look at the last sprint went in terms of 'individuals, interactions, processes, tools and the Definition of Done' (scrum.org). 
<img width="603" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57412626/217064469-54d0500b-f079-432a-8101-1801a8540abf.png">

Sprint Retrospective approaches This template uses a typical approach called 'starfish' which organises the meeting into things we will:

1. Start doing stop doing keep doing do more of do less of 
2.  Another approach is 'FLAP', which stands for Future Considerations, Lessons, Accomplishments, and Problems. 
3.  Also What went well? What didn't go so well? What will we do next? What questions do we have?
