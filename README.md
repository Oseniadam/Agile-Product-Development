# Burndown Chart

A Burndown Chart is a graph which shows the work left to do against time. 
It is used in agile project management as a simple indicator of when the work will be completed. 
Typically the work is shown on the y axis and the time on the x axis.
There are lots of variations of the Burndown Chart. 
For example, the work can be expressed in various ways, it could be, features, story points, or effort. 
Time might be the releases, sprints or iterations. 

This template is easily edited to suit your project.

# Project details and document control 
##  Provide information on the project and document: 
Project Name and Reference Project Manager Document Date Version number   

##  Days 
The timescale that appears at the bottom of the Burndown Chart (on the x axis). This can be changed for each project, for example it might be iterations or sprints.  

##  Goal 
The number of features/story points that you plan to achieve in each time period.  

##  Done 
This is a record of how many features/story points that you actually achieve.  

##  Goal velocity 
This is a calculated field that counts down the target points to zero (completion of the project). It forms the left side of the chart (the y axis).  

##  Remaining 
This is a calculated field that simply deducts 'Done' from 'Remaining'. 
It forms the blue line showing the actual burndown rate.

# Agile Communication Plan
Communication is key to project success. 
The communication plan sets out what, when and how you will communicate with your project stakeholders.

## What 
What document, report or update will be sent.  

## Objective 
Explain the purpose of the communication. 
For example --- progress update --- approval/sign-off ---- quality assurance ---- business buy-in.  

## Who

## Daily Scrum Template
The Stand-up is a daily meeting for the team to briefly review progress, talk about any blockers, and share their plans for the day. 
Usually the team stand up during the meeting, which encourages everyone to 'keep it short'. 

##   Rules of the Daily Scrum 
1.  It must start on time. Anyone can join, but only the core team speak. 
2.  The meeting lasts 15 minutes max. 
3.  It must start at the same time and in the same location everyday. 
4.  The Scrum master ensures that the Scrum happens, but the development team (or core team) run it. 
5.  The Scrum master also makes sure that the meeting keeps to time and that only the core team speak. 
6.  Daily Scrum makes it an efficient and effective way to remove obstacles, speed up decisions and improve communications.
