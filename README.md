# Burndown Chart

A Burndown Chart is a graph which shows the work left to do against time. 
It is used in agile project management as a simple indicator of when the work will be completed. 
Typically the work is shown on the y axis and the time on the x axis.
There are lots of variations of the Burndown Chart. 
For example, the work can be expressed in various ways, it could be, features, story points, or effort. 
Time might be the releases, sprints or iterations. 

This template is easily edited to suit your project.
